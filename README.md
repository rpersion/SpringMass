# SpringMass
Python Spring Mass Physics Engine

Create masses and connect them together. You can connect them with a collider object or a spring object.

When you have finished connecting all of your mass objects, you will need to create a main program loop

Inside the main loop, run Collide() and Forces() on each mass object. After that, use the Move(deltaTime, Gravity) function to translate the position of all the masses.

After that you can draw the masses on some sort of canvas.

Enjoy!
